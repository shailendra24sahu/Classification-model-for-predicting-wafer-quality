Problem Statement /
To build a classification methodology to predict the quality of wafer sensors based on the given training data. 
This is a complete end to end Machine Learning project till deployment. 

Steps involved in this project are -

Functional Architecture
Data Description
Data Validation 
Data Insertion in Database
Model Training 
Prediction Data Description
Data Validation  
Data Insertion in Database 
Prediction 
Deployment

For complete details about the process in every step, kindly refer documents inside LLD directory of this project.

- Starting point of this project is main.py
- For little overview of the coding and implementation part, you can refer to notebook.ipynb file.

Note - In this project I have defined GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. But due to time complexity and long processing time issue in my local machine, I could not use it.
Although code is written for that and it is automated, if you want to use it then go to best_model_finder – tuner.py – Model_Finder class and enable the commented codes.
